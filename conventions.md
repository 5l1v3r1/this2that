# Conventions

these are conventions that may not be common practice, or practiced anywhere,
but for clarity of this project, I will try to hold myself to. These will provide consistency and
make this project easy to use and implement in other open source projects.

### function files (output)
- I will make a best attempt to maintain good style (K&R C), save some places, where rules are better off broken.
- each function file will follow a same basic structure, and will follow an appropriate template.
- each function file will be appropriately named format.language_ext (ie. xml.cpp)
- each function file will begin with a comment on how to compile it properly. (GCC only. sorry? (who doesnt use gcc?!))
- I will try to do things proper rather than hacky workarounds like printing backspaces (I'm working on it!!) 
- I will try to write good documentation as much as is appropriate (not too little, not too much)

### Examples
- a strict folder structure will be maintained, each format will have a folder named after it.
- each format will have one or many examples. How ever many I feel are needed to fully test that format.
- some examples may intentionally contain errors. These files will begin the filename with "error-".
